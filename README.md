## Task Description
The Titanic was responsible for on eof the greatest catastrophe in history leading to the death of over 1500 passengers. Although the loss of lives was preventable if not for the weak safety regulations, the incident can be used to prepare for future incidents and enhace disaster preparedness.
Using the titanic data set, this project entails:

i. To build a model that predicts whether or not a passenger survived the titanic with an f1 score of 80+ %

ii. To identfy the most important features in predicting a passengers survival chances

iii. To identify the ideal training_test split size for the best model accuracy.
